**Prediction of Disease Outbreaks**

**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical health and environmental data, the model can provide early warnings about potential disease outbreaks, helping authorities take preventive measures.

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python,
Machine Learning Models:
Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Linear Regression

**Frameworks/Libraries:**
Pandas,
NumPy,
Scikit-learn,
streamlit.

📊 **Dataset**
The dataset contains historical records of disease occurrences along with relevant environmental and demographic factors. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.

🔍 **Implementation Steps**
Data Collection & Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Model Training (SVM & Linear Regression)
Evaluation & Accuracy Calculation
Prediction & Visualization

**Results**
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
